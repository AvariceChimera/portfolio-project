        Third major project and second team project. again i took up most of the testing and tweaking as well as<br>
        documentation and art assets sadly i was still trying to get back in the saddle after external life events.<br>
        But no one is perfect after all, when making this we used "Robotron 2048" as a basis and made our own plot<br>
        and assets graphically ultimately it was simple but a game that does a few things good is better than a game<br>
        that does a lot of things badly if you ask me. in terms of coding the hardest part was getting the octodirectional<br>
        aiming to work (mostly due to my keyboard ghosting my keys durring testing) but eventually we got there then it was just<br>
        a matter of getting the math to work properly which wasn't all that interesting but hey, it happens, plus a few<br>
        issues with updating my branches but that was just github desktop being weird another uninteresting problem that got fixed.

    <p>no AI tool this time but i feel like i did good for an ameture game maybe with a bit more practice my art will look less... doodled</p>
