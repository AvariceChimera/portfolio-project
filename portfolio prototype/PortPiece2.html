        This was my first time working with a team and in complete honesty i would gladly do it again. My team was very<br>
        understanding with me and gave me a more than fair amount of help in terms of code (mostly just checking and making<br>
        sure it was right which i typically need someone to do out of anxiety) i did a lot of documentation and art work<br>
        as recent events in my life left me... "unfit" to really push myself. but we met deadline and made a pretty solid<br>
        if a little basic shooter game. not much plot or really detail just shoot the robots and survive the waves.<br>
        between waves you could upgrade your shot speed, damage, and even the spread for a triple shot. I i primarily worked<br>
        on the level code which was easy for the most part especially with the support of my team who could more easliy<br>
        identify errors or potential bugs that i typically miss as i get a bit tunnel-visioned trying to reach a point i can<br>
        test and identify what needs to be tweaked or reworked.
