    <p>Hey, how you doing. Don't mind the mess i just haven't had time to clean up<br>
        i used comic sans because it's dyslexia friendly. Never hurts to be accessible<br>
        to see my work click on the buttons in the nav bar or the characters on the side<br>
        they're even at the bottom of this page if you don't want to scroll all the way back up.

        <p> My name is Joshua Crabb and I am a Game Developer.<br>
            i enjoy working with verious aspects of games but try to focus my efforts on making them "feel good"<br>
            both visually and in terms of gameplay so i put my energy into design. from tweaking movement speeds or<br>
            making changes to assets (which in the projects below i mostly made myself) so they pop out more for players to see<br>
            i started coding as a sort of touch & go hobby only really learning bits and pieces. it wasn't until joning triOS that i really<br>
            sunk my teeth into languages and projects. I take a lot of pride in my work and typically need to be pulled<br>
            away lest i lose track of time and focus too long on one problem or aspect i feel that my main drive stems from that<br>
            need to polish, i want games to be as good as possible not just for players but for devs later down the line<br>
            the more polished a game is the less they'll need to fix it later. But with AAA gaming being what it is that level of dedication<br>
            is exceedingly rare unless you look at indie teams or solo devs, but that's enough waxing poetic! i am a passionate<br>
            individual and have a decerning eye trained to spot trends and the mind to work around them, if you want someone who<br>
            works well in a team look no further. now let's make a game worth playing
