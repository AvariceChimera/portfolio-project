    <p>This was my first big solo project that wasn't a tutorial/making galaga i used SDL/OpenGL to build it from the ground up.<br>
    Sadly this project didn't make it to a playable state (time constraints) i'm still proud of it nonetheless<br>
    it was going to be a combitation puzzle/speed game. You would move about a meuseum exhibit trying to steal jewels and<br>
    make an escape via a drainage hatch (the grey circles with a big "E" on them). You could grab one or all five but<br>
    you couldn't leave empty-handed more jewels = more points and all that jazz. Development wasn't that bad, BUGFIXING HOWEVER<br>
    now that was rough honestly it was what caused me to miss the deadline. I was trying to fix a bug with movement and<br>
    the level spawning properly randomized (funnily enough that was the easiest part) and i was so focused on the bug hunt i<br>
    forgot the rest of the game and by the time i wanted to get back to it we had to work on the next project so i<br>
    didn't have the time or ability to finish it however i did make the assests myself (though i did have them touched<br>
    up by my S.O. when i was feeling burnt out) my art isn't top notch but i like to think i have a good eye for it.

    i really wish i could make this a full game but for my first try i feel proud getting as far as i did<br>
    maybe in the future.
