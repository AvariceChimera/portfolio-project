        this section is going to be a bit boring but it can't hurt to list my knowledge. So i made a list of verious languages<br>
        and engines/frameworks and how i'd rate my ability with them (or just how i liked using them) from 1 to 10<br>
        standard rules 1 is worst 10 is best yada yada let's get started!<br>
        <br>
        C++: 5/10. started here and while i understand it bug fixing in it makes me want to pull my hair out so i can/will<br>
        use it again gladly. I just think it'd be best to work in tandem with someone else on any projects using it<br>
        mostly to save my sanity but otherwise i'm confident in my ability to tinker with C++ <br>
        <br>
        SDL/OpenGL: 6/10. made an engine with them and built my first major project (and galaga but that's not something important)<br>
        they were very useful, if a little tedious to set up, and i can comfortably work with either provided i can read the code.<br>
        An issue i did have was the lack of direction a lot of the error messages gave but that's to be expected i guess, see above<br>
        for my experience with bugfixing or look at "Jewel Thief" to learn more.<br>
        <br>
        C#: 4/10. had minor issues with C# but i feel like it was largly due to lacking a visual to see what i was doing<br>
        as i awas doing it. C++ had the same issue but was mitigated by several factors hence my having more confidence<br>
        with it. I can see myself using it more but not without some kind of support, primarily being able to see how my<br>
        changes effect things as i'm making them.<br>
        <br>
        Lua: 8/10. Simple language with lots of bells and whistles to tinker with i had a field day with it and will<br>
        gladly work with it again. However it being so simple comes with the downside of it breaking in ways you can't<br>
        see coming unlike C# or C++. However with that i can't say it enough, languages need to alert you of typos.<br>
        <br>
        Love2D: 7/10. a good compliment to lua and frankly needs to be more popular it has plenty of built in function<br>
        and makes a great tool to learn with. But i wouldn't discount it because of that. if anything that's why it should be<br>
        more widely used simply because if ametures can make good games with it iimagine if a team with real skill got a hold of it<br>
        and wanted to make something big. overall i enjoyed my time with it and feel very confident using it<br>
        <br>
        HTML/CSS: 3/10. ironic i know but i don't think i can code a game with HTML this portfolio? yes clearly i can do that<br>
        a whole game? that's gonna take a while as most of my knowledge with HTML is found in making this CSS is good as a<br>
        supplement but it's also not something i see myself using much or at least well.<br>
        <br>
        Javascript: 1/10. i have used this twice in my life and both times i either had a tutorial in from of me or had no clue<br>
        what i was doing. i am unconfident to say the very least.
